## Queues (Implementing using LinkedList)

-   Contain data nodes
-   Support three main operations:
-   Enqueue adds data to the back of the queue
-   Dequeue removes and provides data from the front of the queue
-   Peek provides data on the front of the queue
-   Can be implemented using a linked list or array
-   Bounded queues have a limited size.
-   Enqueueing onto a full queue causes a queue overflow
-   Queues process data First In, First Out (FIFO)
