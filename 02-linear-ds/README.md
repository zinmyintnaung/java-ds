## Linked Lists:

-   Are comprised of nodes
-   The nodes contain a link to the next node (and also the previous node for bidirectional linked lists)
-   Can be unidirectional or bidirectional
-   Are a basic data structure, and form the basis for many other data structures
-   Have a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
-   Require some maintenance in order to add or remove nodes
-   The methods we used are an example and depend on the exact use case and/or programming language being used

## Doubly Linked Lists Review

-   Are comprised of nodes that contain links to the next and previous nodes
-   Are bidirectional, meaning it can be traversed in both directions
-   Have a pointer to a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
-   Have a pointer to a single tail node, which serves as the last node in the list
-   Require the pointers at the head of the list to be updated after addition to or removal of the head
-   Require the pointers at the tail of the list to be updated after addition to or removed of the tail
-   Require the pointers of the surrounding nodes to be updated after removal from the middle of the list
