## Stack (Implementing using LinkedList)

-   Contain data nodes
-   Support three main operations
-   1. Push adds data to the top of the stack
-   2. Pop removes and provides data from the top of the stack
-   3. Peek reveals data on the top of the stack
-   Implementations include a linked list or array
-   Can have a limited size
-   Pushing data onto a full stack results in a stack overflow
-   Stacks process data Last In, First Out (LIFO)

## Usage

-   Run PizzaDelivery.java to test out the implementation
