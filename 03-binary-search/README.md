-   Initialize the left and right indices as 0 and the length of the array.
-   Create a while loop that continues to execute until the left index equals the right index.
-   Get the value at the index that falls in the middle of left and right.
-   Return the index if the mid-value is equal to target.
-   Set left equal to the current index plus one if the target is greater than the value.
-   Set right equal to the current index minus one if the target is less than the value.
